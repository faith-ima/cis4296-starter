TITLE: STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Owner: Faith Imadegbelo

The project will be a student management system that can be used to perform 
different tasks depending on the type of login privileges (staff or student).  For
authorized staff, they will be allowed to add new students and include
information for them. They will also have the ability to remove students and
include the reason to be updated in the database. For students, they will be able
to log on to view/update their personal information, pay bills, check what books
they need. And if possible have access to an online book management system. In
the end, the entire project can be converted to a mobile application.

The proposed project is based off of Object Oriented Design style of programming
and access to a database which are some of the core goals in the course. Since it
calls for various tasks, it will allow for real world scenarios where project control,
debugging, and testing are all necessary. 

My proposed contribution will include the initialization of the project and setting
up the required classes needed to make the project successful. I also plan on
using some knowledge from a previous database class to help with the database
setup.
